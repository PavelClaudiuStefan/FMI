# Computer-Graphics

Here I've stored the solutions to the problems we got at the Computer-Graphics lab as a progress tracking solution.

In the SVG folder you will find a few examples that implement vectorial graphics manipulated using pure javascript.

The Superman example shows a basic mousemove event that helps superman point lasers to your cursor's position.

The Graph example generates with javascript all the points of a <path/> element, in order to get a rounded graphic that animates between changing it's data. The input is the array of Y's.
